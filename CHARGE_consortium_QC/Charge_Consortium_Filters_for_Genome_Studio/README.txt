Filters from the CHARGE consortium -- untested..

To use the *.flt files will need to be placed in
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Illumina\GenomeStudio

Then go to the SNPTable view in GenomeStudio (funnel shaped button)
select from the dropdown the filter to apply
select load
select ok.



** QUESTION:
Should the subcolumn filters have ALL or ANY Columns as the primary variable?
Think this might be a problem in the SNP Review Filter
